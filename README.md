# The Roommate Hub Project

## Introduction
We are a group of students from CSE 110 course at UCSD. This is a 10 weeks project on developing a local web application. To access our web appllication, please click the link below.

The Roommate Hub is a web page for roommates to simplify to-do lists, bill dividing, remembering information, etc. in a dorm or apartment.
We have seen too many students having issues with their roommates, making their home a place that they don't want to go back to. Our intention is to improve such problem by making the environment for a shared room more mangeable. We hope that even when you are away from home, your leased house, apartment or shared condo would be a place that you would want to go back to.
